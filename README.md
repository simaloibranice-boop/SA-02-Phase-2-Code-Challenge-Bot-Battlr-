About my Project 

Bot Battlr is a small React project where you can see different bots and build your own bot army. You can add or remove bots, and even delete a bot completely from the backend. This project helped me practice React components, props, events, state, and fetching data from a JSON server.  

Features  

- View all bots from the API  
- Add a bot to “Your Bot Army”  
- Remove a bot from your army  
- Delete a bot forever from both the frontend and backend  
- Clean and simple design using CSS  

Components  

- **App.js** — Main component that connects everything  
- **BotCollection.js** — Displays all bots  
- **YourBotArmy.js** — Shows the bots I’ve added to my army  
- **BotCard.js** — Each bot card with info and buttons  

What i have learnt 

- How to fetch data with `useEffect()`  
- How to pass props between components  
- Handling user clicks and updating state  
- Making delete requests with `fetch()`  
- Organizing React components into small parts  

Deploying of my project

The React app was created using **Create React App**, making it a single-page application.  
The backend data is provided by **JSON Server** running on port `8001`.
