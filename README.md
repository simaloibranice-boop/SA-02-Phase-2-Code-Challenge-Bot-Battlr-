About the Project

Bot Battlr is a small React project where you can see different bots and build your own bot army.
You can add or remove bots, and even delete a bot completely from the backend.
This project helped me practice React components, props, events, state, and fetching data from a JSON server.

Features

View all bots from the API

Add a bot to “Your Bot Army”

Remove a bot from your army

Delete a bot forever from both the frontend and backend

Clean and simple design using CSS

Components

App.js — Main component that connects everything

BotCollection.js — Displays all bots

YourBotArmy.js — Shows the bots I’ve added to my army

BotCard.js — Each bot card with info and buttons

What I Learned

How to fetch data with useEffect()

How to pass props between components

Handling user clicks and updating state

Making delete requests with fetch()

Organizing React components into small parts
